Inspiration

I had been thinking of what to do at the start of the experiment. Then I came across a scene called Node 49 . I decided to claim it, but I noticed that two people were already on it, so I had no other option than to find another. But it was Node 49 that gave me the idea of Area 51, so I decided to move to Scene 51. Then I noticed it was a good spot for the story.
